        <h2>Main Ideas</h2>
        <table>

            <tr>
                <td>Open Field system:</td>
                <td>The land was open and not closed off by any fences, but it was divided into strips, each owned by a different family of peasants. Three year rotations were implemented, which meant that they harvested for 3 years but then for one year it is left fallow for the nitrogen to be restored to the soil. This led to a slow process of farming and food shortages. 
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Enclosure movement:</td>
                <td>With the open field system, as scientists and farmers wanted to experiment with new crops, they could only do so with the permission of the landholders in the village to agree to the plan. This led to the development of enclosed fields, where farming could be more efficient.. Many peasant farmers were too poor and dependent on the system of open fields, so many noble landowners were the ones who put fences and enclosed their land, making the land individual shares and peasants soon lost their land. 
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Proletarianization:</td>
                <td>as noble landowners owned most of the land, they got profits by leasing the land to middle class farmers at high prices. These farmers relied on landless rural peasants for labor on the fields. These landless rural workers were known as proletariats, and led to the idea of proletarianization. 
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Putting out system:</td>
                <td>In this system, the merchant loaned, or “put out” raw materials to cottage workers, who processed the raw materials into product, and then gave them back to the merchant who sells them for a profit. The cottage workers were paid by piece, or how much they made. This system led to high production of domestic goods and textiles.

            <tr>
                <td>Debt peonage:</td>
                <td>it was a system similar to serfdom, where a planter or rancher would keep workers in debt bondage on their land by providing them with food, shelter, and money. It was used by the Spanish on indigenous workers. 
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Trade rivalry in Pacific/Asia:</td>
                <td>in the 1500 Spain and Portugal dominated trade. In the 1600s, the Dutch rose to trade, and in the 1700s the British and France were the most dominant, while the Spanish, Portugal, and Dutch had fallen off. Dutch East India Company had controlled Portugal spice trade with India in 1602. However, the Dutch soon fell off as they failed to keep up with competition, and the English East India Company took over.
