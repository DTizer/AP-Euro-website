                <td>Charles X wanted to restore French monarchical rule, so he needed to gain support and remove the Constitutional Charter. He decided the best way was to incite the French into a war, and a diplomatic dispute with Algeria was the perfect thing. French forces of 37k invaded Algeria, and took the capital city in 3 weeks. Happy with the results, Charles repudiated the Constitutional Charter in an attempted coup. The following reaction was a violent revolution, which caused Charles X to flee. His cousin, Louis Phillipe, took his place as the new ruler of France.

                <td>France Second Republic and Revolution: </td>
                <td>Louis Phillipe’s  rule was corrupted by the wealthy bourgeoisie, which caused stagnation and decline in agriculture. This caused the people to be mad, and they demanded a republic, uprising in the streets of Paris by building barricades. The National Guard, supposed to put down the revolution, instead joined them. Louis Napoleon wanted to abdicate in favor of his grandson, but the people did not want another monarchy. To quell the uprising, moderate republicans set up national workshops, and then later created the Constituent Assembly, which had 900 seats, and the election results came out to have 500 monarchists, which angered the people once again. Following that, Blanc was dropped, angering the socialists in France. The assembly continued to dissolve the national workshops, leading once again to uprising and barricades in Paris. A class war began, known as 3 terrible “June Days”, with the republican army coming out on top. The constituent assembly was re-elected, and this time Louis Napoleon won the election, leading to a semi authoritarian government in France.

                <td>Seeing the reactions and revolution in France, liberals in Austria also demanded civil liberties from authoritarian regimes. Viennese students built barricades, and peasants broke out in uprising across the empire. Ferdinand I abolished serfdom, and the peasants lost interest in revolution. However, ethnic differences in Hungary led to nationalism and rising desires for independence. Finally, archduchess Sophia and conservative aristocrats bombarded Prague and  crushed the working class revolt. Heavy artillery used against the Vienna students finally ended the revolution. Francis joseph was then crowned as emperor.
