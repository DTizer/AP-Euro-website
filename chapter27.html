    <h1>Chapter 27: Dictatorships and the Second World War </h1>
    <p>In this chapter, we will explore the rising dictatorships of Stalin, Mussolini, and Hitler, the ideas of Communism and Facism, and how their dictatorships led to World War 2, including diplomacy and relations between the countries of Europe that ultimately caused World War 2. The chapter then explains the events of World War 2, and the ultimate victory of the Allies.

            <tr>
                <td>Conservative Authoritarianism:</td>
                <td>Conservative Authoritarianism is an antidemocratic form of government. This form of government relied on bureaucracies and efforts to control society. They sought to suppress revolutionary enemies and ideologies that would change the authoritarian form of government. They often jailed or exiled political opponents, but did not have ability or desire to control their subjects. Examples are Catherine the Great in Russia and Metternich.

                <td>Totalitarianism: </td>
                <td>This form of government was rising during the period before World War 2, and were considered radical dictatorships. Totalitarian states had their own ideas and desires for what the state should look like as a whole. One-party totalitarian states such as Fascist and Communist Dictatorships used violent political repression and propaganda to gain power. They also dominated social, economic, and intellectual aspects of people’s lives.

            <tr>
                <td>Communism:</td>
                <td>The idea of Communism is inspired by Karl Marx's ideas of equality. Communists wanted a utopia ruled by the working class and there would be no more economic exploitation of capitalism. Society would be based on radical social equality and radical actions are needed to achieve a communist state.

            <tr>
                <td>Facism: </td>
                <td>Facism was embraced by Hitler and Mussolini, who claim they were building a state on the national level. Fascists supported war and the military, and also intervened in economics. They believed the nation was above the people, and the leader of the nation was a figure of the people’s will. Unlike communism, facism did not level class differences, but rather desired a community bound together by nationalism. Fascists also wanted to build a community where everyone was equal in race.

                <td>National Socialism:</td>
                <td>Also known as Nazism, national socialism was a combination of nationalism and racism. National Socialism was the idea that the state must be “purified”, and in the case of Nazi Germany, was to maintain German domination and rid the state of other ethnic classes, like Jews. It is important to note national socialism did not have any socialist ideals.
