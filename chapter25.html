    <h1>Chapter 25: War and Revolution</h1>
    <p>In this chapter, we will explore the causes of WW1, how diplomatic relations between European countries soured and how the tensions to gain Balkan lands ultimately caused the war. We will then discuss the events during war and the idea of total war, followed by the end of the war and the peace treaties and alliances that followed. In addition, we will learn about the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War, and its impact on Russia in the future.

HOwever, close to the end of the war, Germany used their submarines in hopes that they could starve Britain before the US could help them. This caused the US to join in WW1.
