    <h1>Writing Guides</h1>

    <p>In this page, you will find a guide to all the essay based questions in the AP Euro exam. There are three essay based questions, the SAQ, LEQ, and DBQ. These will be practiced throughout the school year, so it will give you many chances to improve on your writing skills and ultimately convey them during the AP Exam. 
    </p>

    <div>
        <h2>SAQ</h2>

        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>The SAQ, or the Short Answer Question, is the most basic and by far the simplest of the three essay based questions. In the SAQ, you are presented with a passage or political cartoon, and then given three questions based on the information given. The questions can be about anything in the time period referenced in the information given. The questions also vary, from cause, effect, significance, similarity, change, etc. To excel in the SAQ, it is important to identify the correct time period and understand the most significant events and specific concepts in that time period. 
        </p>

        <h3>Format:</h3>
        <p>A solid format to follow when writing your answers to each of the three questions is as follows:</p>

            <p>1. Begin with a claim, one that clearly answers the question. </p>
            
            <p>2. Provide one piece of specific evidence to support your claim. </p>
            
            <p>3. Connect your evidence to your claim and explain how it proves your claim and ultimately answers the question. </p>
            
            <p>If you follow this format clearly and concisely, you will be on the right track to ace the SAQ. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>LEQ</h2>

        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>The LEQ, or the Long Essay Question, is an essay which answers one prompt. As the name suggests, unlike the SAQ, the LEQ is much longer and consists of an introduction paragraph and 2-3 body paragraphs, each containing 2 or more supporting pieces of evidence. Just like the SAQ, make sure to read the prompt carefully and fully understand what it is asking. Identify the time period, and determine which reasoning skill would apply best to the prompt: causation, comparison, continuity, or change over time.
        </p>

        <h3>Introduction Paragraph</h3>
        <p>In the introduction paragraph, start with context. In the context, be sure to provide specific examples and events before the time period of the prompt. Using descriptive language and specific names and events will help you earn the full point. For the context, it is better to overwrite than to underwrite, so aim to have as much information as possible, but not too much. Following the context, you will present your thesis. Your thesis should have one overarching argument, followed by two or three individual arguments that support the overarching argument. The two or three individual arguments will represent your body paragraphs. 
        </p>

        <h3>Body Paragraphs</h3>
        <p>For your body paragraphs, the format will be similar to a traditional english essay. First begin with a topic sentence that will present what you are going to argue in the body paragraph and then provide evidence followed by analysis that connects the evidence to your topic sentence and your thesis. In each body paragraph, it is required to have two pieces of evidence, but it is recommended to use three because if one of them is incorrect, you will have a backup. There is no set amount of body paragraphs you can have, but I recommend two because of time management and simplicity. It is better to have less but quality arguments than more but low quality arguments. The rubric for the LEQ requires 4 pieces of evidence, and to receive the full point, your evidence must support your argument. 
        </p>

        <h3>No conclusion but...</h3>
        <p>In a LEQ, and also the DBQ, a conclusion is not required. However, at the end of your essay, you can write a one sentence conclusion that can replace your thesis. If you have enough time by the end of your essay, you can use the opportunity to write a one sentence conclusion that might be stronger than your thesis. If you do so, indicate that you want your conclusion to replace the thesis, and the exam graders will read your conclusion as a thesis instead. 
        </p>

        <h2>DBQ</h2>

        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>The DBQ, or document based question, is similar to the LEQ, but the evidence is given to you. In the DBQ, you are given 7-8 documents, which consist of passages, excerpts, political cartoons, or artwork. The rubric requires you to use at least four documents, and an EBD, or Evidence Beyond the Documents, which is an outside piece of evidence that is not mentioned in the documents at all. There are two more criterias of the DBQ: the use of POV, or Point of View, and the extra point. POV is when you identify the credibility or explain why the person who wrote spoke in the given document supports your argument. The extra point is given when you use all the documents, or you identify 4 or more POVs. 
        </p>

        <p>The format of the DBQ is the same as the LEQ, with the introduction paragraph consisting of context and the thesis, body paragraphs with two or more pieces of evidence, and no conclusion required. 
        </p>

        <h3>Analyzing Documents</h3>
        <p>Analyzing the documents is crucial to understanding the prompt and determining the basis for your arguments. Before writing your DBQ, it is important to take 15 minutes to read over the documents and group them. While reading each document, label the documents with the main idea it is arguing. For example, if the document mentions religions, label it as religion. The documents provided in the DBQ are able to be grouped into similar categories, such as economic, political, religious, etc. A good rule of thumb is to group them in no more than 3 groups. By grouping the documents, it allows for much simpler development of your body paragraphs. Begin reading each document by reading the citation, which will make understanding the document much easier. 
        </p>

        <h3>The POV</h3>
        <p>A major difference between the DBQ and the LEQ is the use of POV. The POV is the analysis of the source of the documents, and connecting it to your argument, explaining how the source supports your argument. The rubric requires you to have at least 2 POVs. One common mistake in the POV is explaining how the source goes against the argument or is not considered to be credible. When writing POV, it is important to identify the credibility of the source and explain how it helps support your argument. The simplest way to do this is identify the role or identification of the person, and explain how his role in society or the country he is from proves his claims to be true and supports your argument. One thing to note is that you cannot use the words credible, trustworthy, or reliable because it is too obvious and makes your POV sound redundant. 
        </p>

        <h3>Evidence Beyond the Documents</h3>
        <p>To provide an adequate EBD, it is important to use specific evidence in the same time period as the prompt. When presenting the EBD, make sure to be specific and describe the event or idea. After that, make sure to connect it back to your argument, which is a step many students miss. It is better to present the EBD at the end of a body paragraph, as a final supporting evidence to your topic sentence. 
        </p>

        <h3>Unicorn Point</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to earn the extra point on the DBQ is to use 4 POVs. One reason for this is it is much less time consuming, and POVs are generally much easier to do with more practice. Choosing the option to use all 7 documents means providing substantial analysis and connections of these documents, which is much more work and takes up much more time. Note that this extra point is not considered extra credit, but is worth one point in the rubric.
