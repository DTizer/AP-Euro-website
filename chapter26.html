        <tr>
            <td>Existentialism:</td>
            <td>Reason and science are incapable of providing insight into the human situation. God, reason and progress are no such things, humans rather live in a world alone and isolated. A person is a sum of his or her actions.

        <tr>
            <td>Logical Positivism:</td>
