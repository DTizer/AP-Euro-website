        <h1>Test Guides</h1>

        <p class="intro">Over the course of the school year, you will take Chapter Tests and Unit Tests that contribute to a big part of your grade. Chapter Tests consist of content from one or two chapters, but Unit Tests consist of content from three chapters, which are sometimes already covered by a Chapter Test. Chapter Tests are much more straightforward and fact based, while Unit Tests require critical thinking and knowledge of facts to answer questions. This page will cover all the tips and tricks you need to know to get a solid score on both the Chapter Test and Unit Test. </p>

        <h2>Chapter Test Guide</h2>

        <h3>What is it? </h3>
        <p>The Chapter test consists of 25-30 questions, depending on how many chapters are being tested. In the first semester, all the Chapter Tests cover only one chapter, so there are 25 questions and 20 minutes given for you to complete the test. In the second semester, the Chapter Tests cover two chapters, so there are 30 questions and 25 minutes given for you to complete the test. </p>

        <h3>Type of Questions:</h3>
        <p>Chapter Tests are simple and straightforward, purely testing your factual knowledge of the chapter(s) covered, and some specifics from previous chapters that are related. Chapter tests should be taken advantage of to keep a high test grade, because it is simple to get a consistent A on Chapter Tests. The best method to ace the chapter test is to memorize all the important events, people, causes, and significance of concepts in the chapter. Memorizing all the content covered in each of the quizlet flashcards provided in this website will suffice, but it is important to also read the textbook and read the sage notes. Chapter Tests tend to have questions that can be answered with very specific content in the textbook, so it is important to know what it covers. Moreover, content from previous chapters that relate to the topics covered in the current chapter might be tested, so it is essential to connect events of the current chapter to previous chapters. These connections will also be presented in class discussions, so pay attention and note down when the teachers mention these connections. 
        </p>

        <h3>Make use of Class Discussions</h3>
        <p>Class discussions are important to the test because they provide a clear understanding of the content, and also drop hints of answers to these questions. During discussions, take note when the teacher talks about causes or reasons of events, because those are important to know and are sometimes difficult to understand through the textbook. 
        </p>

        <h3>Using process of Elimination</h3>
        <p>Since chapter tests are fairly simple once you have memorized the content of the chapter, one general tip is to use the process of elimination when in doubt, or when you do not remember the answer to the question. Sometimes it is easy to eliminate obvious wrong answers, but sometimes it might be difficult, especially when a question asks about something very specific. This might happen once or twice, so I recommend covering the most ambiguous content in the textbook. Chapter Tests never ask questions about content outside of the textbook, so reading the textbook multiple times and memorizing the key facts is vital. 
        </p>

        <h3>Studying tips</h3>
        <p>Studying is important. Do not begin studying the day before the test, because that would lead to short term memory and sleep deprivation. Instead, study the weekend before the test, or if a week before. Because it is a chapter test, studying the weekend before will suffice. Memorizing the quizlet flashcards and reading the textbook multiple times will lead to a solid A on the test. If you want to take your studying to the next level and guarantee a 100%, using practice books that contain chapter summaries and practice questions will help. You can borrow these books in the local library or buy them, and the links will be provided in the resources tab. Do not spend too much time studying for chapter tests, because they are generally easy if you pay attention in discussions and understand the content covered in the textbook before studying. These tips and tricks should lead you to getting consistent A's in Chapter Tests, so good luck!

        <h2>Unit Test Guide</h2>

        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>The Unit Test consists of 55 questions, and covers three chapters, two of which are previous chapters that you have been tested on through a chapter test. You are given 50 minutes to complete the test, so it is essential to keep track of time because these questions will take time to answer. Despite covering previous knowledge, the Unit Test is much more difficult than a Chapter Test and will be in the same format as the multiple choice test on the AP Exam. In a Unit Test, either a passage, quote, or picture/political cartoon will be presented, and there will be 2-5 questions regarding the provided content. The questions will require you to think critically and connect your knowledge of the chapters with the given source material. 
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Questions</h3>
        <p>Because critical thinking is involved, it is crucial to score all the factual based questions, which come up once or twice per source material. These questions are the simplest in the Unit Test, and are similar to those in a Chapter Test. To perfect your answers for the factual questions in a Unit Test, memorizing the quizlet flashcards is once again essential. For the critical thinking questions, they require you to connect your knowledge of the chapters and the provided source material. These questions often ask about the ideologies, causes, effects, and significance of events in the source material. 
        </p>

        <h3>Approaching each Question</h3>
        <p>For the Unit Test, a source material plus its questions will be addressed as a section. For every section, it is important to read the provided passage, which is the most common source material. Begin by reading the citation, which states the year it was written and who wrote it. By reading that information first, you can identify what time period the source material is addressing and also possibly what event or place. Read the full passage, no matter how long it is. While reading, try to identify the topic the passage is addressing. If necessary, read the passage more than once to grasp a complete understanding of it. Then, once you understand the event, place, and time period of the passage, continue by answering the following questions. If you follow this process, it should be simple to understand any passage provided, which leaves the rest to critical thinking. 
        </p>

        <p>In answering critical thinking questions, it is essential to know the causes, effects, and reasons of specific events. Once you have identified the time period and event the source material is referring to, you can determine the causes and effects of the event from your knowledge. It is also important to know the events before and after the event addressed in the source material. If the source material is addressing an ideology, make sure you know who the idea originates from and what other significant person in the chapters might have the same belief. These types of questions will be asked, so be prepared with knowledge beyond the source material.
        </p>

        <p>The best way to practice answering critical thinking questions is to connect events or ideas of a chapter. A good practice is to think of three events, or ideas in the chapters, and explain to yourself how they connect to each other, and all the important people involved in the events or ideas. Doing this will help solidify your understanding of the chapters, and also help you connect information easily when taking the unit test. 
        </p>

        <h3>Making Predictions</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, it is possible to predict what topics the Unit Test will cover. To do this, identify the most important ideas and events in the chapter, and study how they relate to each other. Since Unit Tests require more critical thinking, do not worry about memorizing every fact and detail in each chapter, but rather understand the causes, effects, and reasons for the most significant topics in the chapter. 
        </p>

        <h3>Final Words</h3>
        <p>The Unit Test is curved depending on the average of all AP Euro classes. The curve gradually becomes lower as the school year goes on, so it is important to constantly stay above the curve. Getting a score above the curve will provide a huge boost to your grade. Do not be crestfallen after the first Unit Test, because it is a challenging test and no one gets a great score on the first one. The important thing is to improve your score every time and stay above the curve. By training your skills in the Unit Test, it will aid you in the multiple choice section on the AP Exam. Following all these tips should guide you, and good luck on your AP Euro journey.
